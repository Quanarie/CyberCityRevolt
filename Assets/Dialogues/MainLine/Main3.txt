What do you think, Spark? I fucked them up real big, didn't I?
For sure, you went all-out, mad props!
I am burned out as fuck, that is not usual at all. What is wrong with this place?
I think it's all about the amount of security shit here, this is the hardest system to jack into i've ever seen.
I guess you are right, pal. I hope. However, I have a bad feeling.
Everything will be great, boss. I bet.
