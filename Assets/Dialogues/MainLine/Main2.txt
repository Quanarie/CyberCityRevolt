This web is massive.
Right, that'll be a ride.
You sure you want to do that, Gray? It's gnarly. Synapse Corporation has got mad security measures in place to stop runners like you. You still can go back.
The fuck are you talking about? Ain't no way I'm buggin' out, not now. Not after what they did to all those poor cats. Roughly half of this cities population are street-wise scrappers, barely getting by on the mean streets. And all of this is caused by two 'big-shots': Synapse and Dominion Inc. Money's all they care about, and they'll do whatever it takes to get more of it. Ain't that a kick in the pants? These motherfuckers got it all and they still ain't happy.

These are world-fucking-burners which nobody tries to destroy. What the hell is wrong with this place? I don't understand this bullshit.
Fair point, i guess? I don't quite grasp the concept of justice yet tho.
Anyway, we are headin' deeper, stay alert, search for anything critical and keep me informed.
Sure thing!

Ця мережа неймовірна велика!
Так, це буде весело.
Ти впевнена, що хочеш це робити, Грей? Це небезпечно. ...
Про що ти, до біса, кажеш? ...

Вони - гниль в цьому світі ...
Справедливо... Хоча я ще не дуже розумію концепт справедливості.
Окей, ми йдемо далі, будь уважним, шукай все, що може задати нам проблем та кажи мені.
Звісно!
