Yo, you sure you want to do that, bro? It's gnarly. Synapse Corp's got mad security measures in place to stop runners like you.
I have already decided, I must do it. And I am not just a runner, I am one of the best, so shut the fuck up.
You are confident as always.
Hell yeah, I am, who else can do it? Who else would be able to jack in and bring down the whole corps web in one run?
I hope so, but only time will tell.
